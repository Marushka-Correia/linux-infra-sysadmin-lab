# Day 5 – Linux Networking & SSH

On day 5 I learnt about **basic Linux networking concepts** and **SSH**, which is the the main
way Linux servers are accessed and managed remotely.

My main focus of learning was: 
- How a Linux server connects to a network
- How to check if the network is working
- What SSH is and why it is critical in real environments

Main Networking concepts to remember:
 - **IP Address** → Address of the server
- **Hostname** → Name of the server
- **Port** → Door used by services
- **SSH** → Secure way to access servers remotely
- **Firewall** → Controls allowed network traffic
